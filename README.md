Standing for: Emergence by Recommendation Systems

What occurs to our individual beliefs when we throw screens and Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram onto human society? 

Can the recommendation algorithms embodied by such social media platforms be simulated? 

Here we look to model belief based multi-agent interaction within recommendation information environments using Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies and Collaborative Filtering (CF) in tandem. Interaction between agents must be done through the medium of a corpus of posts, analogous to items that appear in social media feeds (images, news articles, etc.). This is implemented and visualized using Unity 3D.
